    <p><span class="italic">Jan 31, 2017</span><br/>Copper Highway (beta) is up and running!  We're starting this service out with one VPN server (located physically in Portland, OR) with plans to include more cities (and countries) if the interest is strong enough.  To join, <a href="index.php?create-account">create an account</a> and request access.
